## **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

### **Getting Started & Onboarding**

**What happens to my existing Stripe subscriptions after migration?**
After migration is confirmed, ChaChing takes over billing while preserving all historical Stripe data. Subscriptions continue billing on their normal renewal dates.

**Can I onboard without connecting a Stripe account?**
Yes. If you don’t have existing Stripe subscriptions, you can skip the migration step and start using ChaChing for new customers and subscriptions.

**How long does the migration process take?**
Migration time depends on the number of subscriptions and related data. During migration, ChaChing continues monitoring Stripe and imports any new subscriptions created.
