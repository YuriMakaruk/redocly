# User Registration & Onboarding Guide

The ChaChing onboarding process guides you through setting up your account, configuring your branding, selecting your integration type, importing data from Stripe, and reviewing all changes before completing your migration. Before you begin, it’s helpful to understand what happens once the migration is completed, as this ensures a smooth transition and clear expectations.

**What Happens After the Migration**

When you complete the onboarding flow and approve the migration, ChaChing automatically handles all required steps behind the scenes:

1. Your imported Stripe subscriptions will be cancelled in Stripe.
    
    ChaChing takes over billing responsibility while preserving your historical records.
    
2. **Subscriptions will be billed on their normal renewal dates.**
    
    Any past-due subscriptions will be retried automatically after migration.
    
3. **ChaChing will sync all necessary dependencies**, including:
    - Customers
    - Tax rates
    - Product lists
    - Related metadata
4. **The sync process may take some time.**
    
    During this period, customers can continue creating new subscriptions. ChaChing will monitor your Stripe account and import these automatically. You will receive a notification once the full import and synchronization are complete.
    
5. **Your historical Stripe data remains intact.**
    
    Nothing is deleted from your Stripe dashboard—your past information stays available for safe keeping and audit purposes.

* Downloadable invoices

In this step, you can personalize the look and feel of your tenant, such as:

- Upload your company logo
- Choose your primary and accent colors
- Preview how your branding will look in ChaChing

Click **Continue** once you’re satisfied with the preview.

**Note**: You can update these settings later in Settings → Company & Branding. For details, refer to [Company and Branding](./settings/CompanyandBranding.md)

## Step 3. Integration Type

In this step, you select how your platform currently processes payments. ChaChing supports multiple integration models, so choosing the correct one ensures you receive the correct setup instructions in the next steps.

ChaChing always uses Stripe as the payment processor. This step defines where and how the payment page is displayed.

You will see three options:

- **Hosted Page** – Customers are redirected to a ChaChing-hosted payment page (replaces Stripe Checkout links).
- **API Solution** – Use this option if your application makes direct Stripe Billing API calls and you plan to migrate those calls to ChaChing’s API.
- **Both** – if you use both hosted page checkout and direct API calls.

After selecting an option, click **Continue** to proceed.

### Option 1: Replace Hosted Page

If you selected **Hosted Page** or **Both**, you will receive instructions to replace your existing Stripe Checkout link.

You can:

- Copy your new ChaChing Checkout link
- Use the embedded version or the external hosted page
- Confirm all previous Stripe URLs have been replaced

Click **I replaced the link** when complete.

### Option 2: Replace API Endpoints

If you selected **API Integration**, ChaChing will guide you through updating your Stripe API calls with ChaChing API calls.

You’ll find:

- A link to the API documentation.
  
  Use the provided link to access ChaChing’s API documentation.
- Replace Stripe API calls
  
  Update your application to replace all existing Stripe Billing and Invoicing endpoints with the corresponding ChaChing API endpoints.
  ChaChing mimics Stripe’s API structure to accept similar parameters and return compatible responses.

- A confirmation step to proceed once you’ve updated your integration

Click **Continue** to proceed.

**Important Notes**
* ChaChing does not currently provide a visual endpoint-by-endpoint mapping.
* API compatibility is designed to minimize changes, but testing is required before going live.
* This option is intended for teams with existing custom Stripe integrations.

## Step 4: Stripe Migration

If you already have active Stripe customers, ChaChing can import them for you.

Сhoose between:

- **Migrate from Stripe**
- **I don’t have existing subscriptions**

### 4.1 Connect Your Stripe Account

To import subscriptions, provide your Stripe keys:

- Stripe Secret Key
- Stripe Public Key

Once validated, ChaChing will fetch your subscriptions so you can decide which ones to migrate.

Click **Continue**.

## Step 5: Subscription Selection

You will see a table of all subscriptions retrieved from Stripe.
{% img src="./images/Subscription.svg" alt="Subscription.svg" withLightbox=true width="" height="" /%}
Here you can:

- Select all subscriptions
- Select only active subscriptions
- Select first 100
- Select individually
- Review amounts, dates, customer names, emails, and billing cycles

A summary panel shows how many subscriptions you’ve selected and their total monthly value.

Click **Continue** when ready.

**Select Subscriptions – Field Reference**

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Subscription ID** | Unique identifier of the subscription imported from Stripe. |
| **Status** | Current subscription state (e.g., active, trial, paused). Helps determine which subscriptions are eligible for migration. |
| **Customer Name** | Full name of the customer associated with the subscription. |
| **Customer Email** | Email address of the customer. Used for billing communication and subscription mapping. |
| **Start Date** | The date when the subscription originally started in Stripe. |

| **Renewal Date** | The next billing date when the subscription will renew after migration. |
| **Amount** | Price the customer is currently paying for the subscription. |

## Step 6: Review Migration Summary

In this step, ChaChing calculates your expected monthly savings compared to Stripe.

{% img src="./images/Savings.svg" alt="Savings.svg" withLightbox=true width="" height="" /%}
You’ll see a comparison of Stripe’s 0.7% fee vs ChaChing’s 0.35% fee

Below the savings section, you’ll be asked to connect your bank account.

### 6.1 Connect Your Bank

To receive payouts and allow automatic collection of processing fees, you must connect your bank account.

We use Plaid to securely link your bank account.

When completed successfully, you will see:

- Bank name
- Masked account number
- A confirmation badge

Сlick **Continue**.

## 7. Review All Changes

- Number of subscriptions
- Number of customers
- Number of products
- Sales tax details
- Total subscription value
- Amount saved per month after moving from Stripe to ChaChing based on current subscription fees.
